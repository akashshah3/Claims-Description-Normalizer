## 🎯 What This Project Does

Insurance companies receive hundreds of **unstructured claim descriptions** daily. Claims adjusters and customers write them freely, making them inconsistent and hard to process. This tool automatically extracts structured data from these descriptions using AI.

### Input Example:
```
Customer reported minor accident on rear bumper, scratches only, no injuries, 
estimated cost ₹7,000. Incident happened yesterday at parking lot near office.
```

### Output Example:
```json
{
  "loss_type": "Accident",
  "severity": "Low",
  "affected_assets": "Rear bumper (scratches)",
  "estimated_loss": "₹7,000",
  "incident_date": "Yesterday",
  "location": "Parking lot near office",
  "confidence": "High",
  "extraction_explanation": "Classified as 'Accident' with 'Low' severity..."
}
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Prompt Engineering**
The system uses **few-shot prompting** to teach Gemini what to extract:
- System prompt defines the AI's role as an insurance analyst
- 4 example claim → output pairs demonstrate the desired format
- Clear instructions for JSON structure with 8 specific fields

### 2. **AI Processing**
When you submit a claim:
- Text is sent to Gemini 2.0 Flash with the engineered prompt
- AI analyzes keywords, context, and patterns
- Returns structured JSON with confidence levels

### 3. **Post-Processing**
The app enhances the output:
- Extracts keywords from the AI's explanation
- Highlights those keywords in the original text
- Validates all required fields are present
- Formats data for visual display

### 4. **Visualization**
Results are presented in an intuitive UI:
- Color-coded severity levels (green/orange/red/purple)
- Confidence meters and progress bars
- Tabbed interface for different views
- Professional card-based layout
